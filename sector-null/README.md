# Sector Null

A top-down sci-fi survival shooter and competition remix of [Abandon All Hope by Josh Werner](https://codepen.io/editor/joshwerner/pen/01a18d27-5cbe-77c4-9685-9f3836db15e6). Keep the reactor deck clear as rogue security units breach the bulkheads. After each wave, the operator stands still while you choose an upgrade.

## Status

Playable first build. The wave system, enemy pathing, destructible entrances and character animation are adapted from the supplied original. Sector Null has a new Three.js reactor deck, armoured operator, security drones, interface and procedural Web Audio effects. The Core Zero art direction informed the smoked glass, machined hardware and cyan and amber lighting. Best runs and settings are saved in the browser.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm run build` writes a static site to `dist/`. Use `npm run preview` to serve that build locally. The browser needs WebGL. The menu track loops across the intro and main menu. If the browser blocks autoplay, use the title screen's Start prompt to enable sound. Selecting Play switches to the gameplay score.

The gameplay score uses the full-length loops in `assets/score/`. Wave-start and wave-clear stingers are disabled to avoid overlapping cues. Clearing a wave crossfades over 0.9 seconds into the upgrade loop at 38% gain with a 1 kHz low-pass filter, giving the break a quieter, softer sound. Combat music fades back in only when the next wave starts. Waves 1–4 use the early loop and wave 5 onward uses the late loop. Wave 4 switches on the next bar with a short crossfade if eight drones are alive at once. Pausing freezes the music and wave timing together.

Supply pickup notices appear one at a time. The first pickup of each type shows an explanation beneath its name for 4.5 seconds: shields restore 1 shield, Overcharge doubles damage for 10 seconds, and Infinite Cell refills the magazine and allows firing without reloading for 8 seconds. Later pickups show only the name. The game remembers each explanation in this browser after its full reading time; interrupted hints can appear again next run. Existing players see the expanded explanations once after this update.

The bottom-right weapon display shows your current magazine and adds visible rifle parts as you pick weapon upgrades.

The pulse rifle uses a short energy sweep with a quieter noise transient. Shot pitch gradually drops by up to three semitones as the cell empties. At one remaining charge, a low-energy beep and amber LAST CHARGE label warn you; recharging shows RECHARGING… and a progress bar. A power-down tone leads into a rising charge hum timed to the recharge duration, followed by a ready chirp and cyan CELL READY label. These labels also appear on mobile. Infinite Cell keeps full-energy shot pitch and suppresses low-charge warnings and manual recharging. Pausing freezes the charge audio; interrupted recharges stop their hum.

Destroyed drones burst into sparks and scattered parts. Reduced-motion settings suppress the blast flash and cut the spark count.
